# File Zipper using Huffman Encoding
This is a File Zipper project which I have created using Huffman Coding algorithm, which is lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.
It currently works only for **text** files.

**To Zip/Compress a file:**
1. Click on the "Choose File" button
2. Select the file which you want to compress
3. Click on "Encode" Button and download the encoded/compressed text file.

**To UnZip/ Decompress a file:**
1. Click on the "Choose File" button
2. Select the file which you want to decompress
3. Click on "Decode" Button and download the decoded/original text file.
